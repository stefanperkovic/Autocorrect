| March 5  | 10:45am - 12:00 | Got introduced to the start of our autocorrect project. Discussed potential ways to approach the problem set including using tries. Goal is to get runtime and edit distance dependent on length of the word not dictionary. Also thought about how to use potentially use arrays or even AI. |
| March 7  |   8:45am-10am   |    Thought about ideas of how to find and keep track of edit distance in a time efficient manner. We discussed using dynamic programming with a tabulation approach using a 2D-array where we compare two words and we keep track of the edit distance to match sequences at given locations. |
| March 11 | 1:40pm - 2:40pm |            Learned about the levenshtein and how to use the tabulation approach to find out based on previous results and the different options. It reminds me a bit of the ideas that I had earlier about how to solve the problem set. Worked onb thinking about how to put this into code. |
| March 17 |  10:40 - 11:55  |   Worked on coding the levenshtein distance by creating a new function to find the distance between two words. Also worked on the runTest function to find all the words below a certain threshold for a given misspelled word. Also learnt about nGrams but didn't work on implementing yet. |
