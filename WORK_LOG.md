| March 5  | 10:45am - 12:00 |             Got introduced to the start of our autocorrect project. Discussed potential ways to approach the problem set including using tries. Goal is to get runtime and edit distance dependent on length of the word not dictionary. Also thought about how to use potentially use arrays or even AI. |
| March 7  |   8:45am-10am   |                Thought about ideas of how to find and keep track of edit distance in a time efficient manner. We discussed using dynamic programming with a tabulation approach using a 2D-array where we compare two words and we keep track of the edit distance to match sequences at given locations. |
| March 11 | 1:40pm - 2:40pm |                        Learned about the levenshtein and how to use the tabulation approach to find out based on previous results and the different options. It reminds me a bit of the ideas that I had earlier about how to solve the problem set. Worked onb thinking about how to put this into code. |
| March 17 |  10:40 - 11:55  |               Worked on coding the levenshtein distance by creating a new function to find the distance between two words. Also worked on the runTest function to find all the words below a certain threshold for a given misspelled word. Also learnt about nGrams but didn't work on implementing yet. |
| March 18 |  9:50 - 10:20   |                                  Worked on getting the levenstein distance to work properly. I originally forgot the swap case so I had to add that in when comparing letters and also do math.mix twice to account for that case in the problem. Also forgot to do +1 in my deletion case so added that. |
| March 19 |   8:45 - 9:25   |     Worked on trying to fix my error that my words were not properly displayed after calculating levenshtein distance. My calculation seemed good, but I wasn't sorting them. I worked on starting to create an insertion sort to sort by edit distance. I still need to add the alphabetic sort to that. |
| March 19 |   9:25 - 9:55   | Implemented insertion sort before I returned the array in my runTest. Shifts a word to the right to make room for key if it has a higher edit distance than the key or if it is below the key alphabetically but they have the same edit distance. This solves the problem set and passes the test cases. |
| March 20 |   1:45 - 3:00   |                                            Worked on my comments and code for levenshtein distance and for run test. Started working on my ReadMe and text file and deciding how to implement them. Thought about maybe doing n-grams or something else such as a trie but stuck with my simple approach. |
