| March 5  | 10:45am - 12:00 | Got introduced to the start of our autocorrect project. Discussed potential ways to approach the problem set including using tries. Goal is to get runtime and edit distance dependent on length of the word not dictionary. Also thought about how to use potentially use arrays or even AI. |
| March 7  |   8:45am-10am   |    Thought about ideas of how to find and keep track of edit distance in a time efficient manner. We discussed using dynamic programming with a tabulation approach using a 2D-array where we compare two words and we keep track of the edit distance to match sequences at given locations. |
