# Autocorrect

# Overview
This project implements a command-line autocorrect tool written in Java. It suggests similar words from a dictionary when a user inputs a potentially misspelled word. The tool uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm to measure the edit distance between the input word and dictionary words, returning suggestions within a specified threshold. The program is designed to be efficient and responsive, mimicking the fast autocorrect features found in modern text-based platforms.
